# SteamShutdown
Automatic shutdown after Steam downloads have finished.

## What is it?

First program that uses actual steam metadata which indicates directly what downloads are still running.  
I don't use any hack like tracking hard drive or network usage.  
So this is the first reliable program that shutdowns the PC if all steam downloads have finished.

## Usage
It has a "two-columns-design".  
The right column contains tracked downloads and vice-versa. If all tracked downloads finished, the pc will shutdown.  
Not satisfied with the design yet, each suggestion is welcomed.
