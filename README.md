# SteamShutdown
Automatic shutdown after Steam downloads have finished.

## What is it?

First program that uses actual steam metadata which indicates directly what downloads are still running.  
I don't use any hack like tracking the hard drive or the network usage.  
So this is the first reliable program that shutdowns the PC as soon as all steam downloads have finished.

## Usage
It has a "two-columns-design".  
The right column contains tracked downloads and vice-versa. If all tracked downloads finished, the pc will shutdown.
